UPDATE DATA MODEL IN CLOUDFLARE -- I think i did this

dropdown for test presses options -- Sort down but should check the numbers

WHAT DO CHANGE
- unique generated in the form that can be related to Monday because using the project name is too brittle if the monday id is unavailable.
- at some point it should be locked when its been approved or whatever?
- auto generate a lead for the person

- first name and last name separated
- but contact name is concatenated
- can select up to three colors
- set email to the email column
- tesrt pressing: 2,5,10,N/A
- how did you hear about us for source
  personal connection - friend of good neighbor
  repeat - not my first time with good neighbor
  google -was googling
  referral - heard about good neighbor from a friend


  once they complete it-- some celebratatory message

  you will hear from your good neighbor

  restart if submit fails

  receipt more compact and friendly
