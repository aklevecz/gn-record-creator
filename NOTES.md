Monday sync? If data exists in monday but not locally then fill it in? Might be a weird edge case ultimately
 - There might be a better way to share project across devices, but this also feels like overkill

email interaction

in projects
- gallery - click into the project - dont remember what this means

engage for newsletter if they are playing around - some share cta


CHECK IF MONDAY ID ACTUALLY EXISTS

The project details updates are confusing and/or overlapping
 - It seems pretty good for persisting data, but it is difficult to untangle discrepancies
 - I'm going to try and solve by component level detail checking, i.e. someting changes in the questions and the user responses are stale
