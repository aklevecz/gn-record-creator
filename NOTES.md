- submission details is not showing generated or uploaded cover photo
- don't let 3d record overlap with form
- better form validation
- maybe not important for only the first name appeared in "Contact" at first
- maybe not important but I was able to create duplicates with new tabs
- new tabs won't be in sync -- could literally just refresh them if they are in different tabs? -- REFRESH DOES SEEM TO WORK
    - So possible detection:
      - on blur
      - return to tab, then refresh -- might be too aggressive -- only do this if multiple tabs -- though it should still be fast as fuck
